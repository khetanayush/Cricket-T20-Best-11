# Problem Statement

- Create a team of Best 11 Players from among all the players who played in T20 world cup final
- The team should be able to score at least 180 runs on an average
- They should be able to defend at least 150 runs on an average


# Criteria on which the players are selected
## Openers

![b](https://github.com/khetanayush/Cricket-T20-Best-11/assets/131992182/3ad4c0af-5875-4d72-a670-cbe0eb341009)

#### This Partnership would be able to give us at least 50 runs in 1st five overs



## Anchors/Middle Order

![c](https://github.com/khetanayush/Cricket-T20-Best-11/assets/131992182/cf4090ee-3371-46e4-8fc2-3b363661aa49)

#### We have 3 players as anchors and now as overall we have 5 players which will give us at least a score of 120+



## Finisher/Lower Middle Anchor

![d](https://github.com/khetanayush/Cricket-T20-Best-11/assets/131992182/6475c565-d99b-4bb7-aff0-2324c9c4d55e)

#### Single player who will hit like crazy but if we loose middle order so badly, so this person will be able to stabilize the innings and order the rest of the lower order batsmasn



## All-Rounders/Lower Order

![e](https://github.com/khetanayush/Cricket-T20-Best-11/assets/131992182/b0bbaed8-4e42-4494-8655-2f2a81965964)

#### So our 6th and 7th player will be All Rounders. Mostly these can be spinners. So, these spinners are the ones who can hit and start hitting without thinking in the last overs 



## Specialist Fast Bowlers

![f](https://github.com/khetanayush/Cricket-T20-Best-11/assets/131992182/2e1ed630-d904-4db4-9012-1077638c0a38)

#### Our last 3 players are the fast bowlers which can take wickets at least every 16 balls or less. They can bowl vey fast and bowl dot balls over 40% which is great for a T20 game.
